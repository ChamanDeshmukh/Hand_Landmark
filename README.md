# Hand Landmark Detection

This project utilizes Google's MediaPipe library for hand landmark detection and Matplotlib for 3D visualization to create a system capable of distinguishing between left and right hands and visualizing their landmarks in a 3D space.

## Features:

- Accurate hand landmark detection using Google's MediaPipe library.
- Differentiation between left and right hands based on landmark data.
- Visualization of hand landmarks in a 3D space using Matplotlib.
- Optional user interface for controlling input and settings.

## Requirements:

- Python
- MediaPipe
- Matplotlib
